# About Me

I am a Senior Researcher in Trustworthy Systems at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/christopher-burr). I lead the Innovation and Impact Hub for the [Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/tric-dt).

In general, I think of myself as an interdisciplinary researcher who is passionate about a wide variety of topics and their intersections. Admittedly, this creates complications in academic circles, as people typically want to place others inside neat departmental boundaries. However, it really doesn't do a good job of capturing my interest or expertise.

For instance, I enjoy reading philosophy as much as writing Python, and detailed data analysis as much as designing skills workshops. My curiosity also ranges from empirical studies of human decision-making to the complex networks of large language models. In short, the following phrase resonates well with how I see myself:

> A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.

## Research Impact

I strongly believe that addressing major societal challenges requires deep collaboration. As such, my research connects theory with practice to achieve tangible and meaningful outcomes. This approach has led to direct contributions to public policy, including work featured in the UK Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology's (DSIT) [Introduction to AI Assurance framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introduction-to-ai-assurance/introduction-to-ai-assurance).

This belief also drives the creation and application of free and open-source resources like the [Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) Platform](https://assuranceplatform.azurewebsites.net/). This methodology is now integral to major initiatives such as the £8.8M EPSRC-funded [CVD-Net project](https://cvdnet.org.uk/), where I co-lead the work package focused on assurance, engagement, and ethics. Additionally, the [Turing Commons](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/turing-commons/) project I co-founded, provides valuable educational resources for responsible innovation as one of two strategic skills project for the Alan Turing Institute's Turing 2.0 strategy.

Furthermore, my work fosters consensus and shared practice within key technology domains. This includes leading the Special Interest Group on Uncertainty and Trust for the [UKRI Digital Twin Network+](https://dtnetplus.ac.uk/) and co-authoring influential papers, such as the [Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance of Digital Twins](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14259252) report, which was developed collaboratively with several partners and organisations to help operationalise assurance principles within the UKs digital twinning community.

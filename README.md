I am an Senior Researcher in Trustworthy Systems at the [Alan Turing Institute's](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/christopher-burr), in the Tools, Practices, and Systems programme. I also lead the Innovation and Impact Hub for the Turing's Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins (TRIC-DT).

My research expertise includes trustworthy AI systems 🤝, digital twinning 🔁, responsible research and innovation ⚖️, data and AI ethics 🤖, and philosophy of cognitive science 🧠. I currently lead the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance of Digital Twins (TEA-DT) project, supported by a grant from the UKRI's BRAID programme.

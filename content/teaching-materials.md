## Turing Commons

The Turing Commons is an online platform I created, in collaboration with others at the Alan Turing Institute, to support open dialogue and reflection about the responsible design, development, and deployment of data-driven technologies. On this platform you can find a range of freely available teaching materials, including the following courses:

- [Responsible Research and Innovation](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/turing-commons/rri/index.html)
- [Public Engagement of Data Science and AI](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/turing-commons/ped/index.html)
- [AI Ethics & Governance](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/turing-commons/aeg/index.html)

## A Citizen's Guide to Data: Ethical, Social, and Legal Issues

This guide was produced to support specific activities associated with a Resident’s Panel, organised and run by Camden City Council and Involve. The content was designed to support the participants with understanding some of the ethical, legal, and social issues surrounding data use by local government.

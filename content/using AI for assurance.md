Advancements in AI and related technologies have opened up new avenues for automating and enhancing assurance case development. Here are some contemporary techniques that could further this field:

1. **Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms**: Modern machine learning algorithms, especially those in natural language processing (NLP) and understanding, could automate parts of the assurance case development process. For instance, AI can analyze vast amounts of textual data to identify relevant evidence, assess its quality, and suggest connections to specific claims in an assurance case. Techniques like sentiment analysis, text classification, and information extraction could be particularly useful.
    
2. **Deep Learning for Pattern Recognition**: Deep learning models are adept at identifying patterns and anomalies in large datasets, which can be crucial in assurance cases, particularly in safety-critical systems. These models can process and analyze data from various sources, such as logs, sensor outputs, and operational data, to provide evidence for or against specific safety claims.
    
3. **Ontology-Based Approaches**: An ontology-based approach to assurance case development can help in structuring arguments and managing the relationships between different components of the case. By creating a formal representation of the knowledge domain, ontologies can assist in ensuring consistency, completeness, and correctness of the arguments made in assurance cases.
    
4. **Interactive Visualization Tools**: Modern visualization tools can present assurance case data in a more interactive and understandable manner. These tools can help stakeholders explore the assurance case, understand the relationships between different parts, and identify areas that need further examination or evidence.
    
5. **Model Checking and Formal Methods**: While Rushby discussed formal methods in his paper, advancements in model checking can provide more powerful and efficient ways to verify the correctness of systems against specified properties. These methods can be integrated into the assurance case development process to provide a strong foundation for safety and reliability claims.
    
6. **Blockchain for Evidence Management**: Blockchain technology could be used for managing and verifying the integrity of evidence used in assurance cases. By using a decentralized and tamper-evident ledger, stakeholders can ensure that the evidence has not been altered and is traceable.
    
7. **AI-driven Simulation and Testing**: AI can be used to simulate various scenarios and test cases, which can provide valuable evidence for assurance cases. This is particularly useful in complex systems where traditional testing might not cover all possible scenarios.
    
8. **Integration with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipelines**: In software engineering, integrating assurance case development into CI/CD pipelines can ensure continuous assessment and updating of assurance cases as the system evolves.

## CVD-Net
From October 2024, I will be co-leading a work package—focused on Trustworthy Assurance and Patient Engagment—for the EPSRC-funded CVD-Net projeect. This project, led by Professor Steve Niederer will design and build fully accurate digital twins of participants’ hearts from health data, including medical records, hospital scans and information from wearable and implanted monitors.

## Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance of Digital Twins
I am principal investigator for the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance for Digital Twins (TEA-DT) project will continue development and validation of an existing open-source platform, known as the [Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) Platform](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AssurancePlatform), which has been designed by researchers at the Alan Turing Institute and the University of York to help users navigate the process of addressing the aforementioned challenges. This work has also been supported by the UK's Responsible Technology Adoption Unit (Department for Science, Innovation and Technology) and the AI Standards Hub.

This project was funded by the UKRI BRAID programme. You can read more about this project here: https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/trustworthy-and-ethical-assurance-digital-twins-tea-dt 

## Innovation and Impact Hub (TRIC-DT)
I lead the Innovation and Impact Hub for the Turing's Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins (TRIC-DT). The Innovation and Impact Hub helps coordinate and convene the scientific aims and objectives of the TRIC-DT's three themes—natural environment, health, and infrastructure—by supporting the development of open and reproducible tools, driving impact with diverse stakeholders, building and supporting multi-disciplinary communities of practice, and embedding best practices for responsible research and innovation throughout the TRIC-DT.

## Turing Commons
I co-founded and co-lead the [Turing Commons](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/turing-commons)—an online skills and training platform to support open dialogue and reflection about the responsible design, development, and deployment of data-driven technologies. Through this platform, you can access many free resources and content, and also access information about how you can contribute to its ongoing development.

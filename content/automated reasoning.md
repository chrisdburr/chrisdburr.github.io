Automated reasoning, a field at the intersection of computer science and logic, has seen various approaches and frameworks. Here are some of the most notable ones:

1. **Formal Framework for Collective Systems**: Palak and Wojtkiewicz (2021) discuss a theoretical framework that combines various reasoning methods into a collective system using ==graph theory==. This framework is useful for building and testing specific approaches in automated reasoning [(Palak & Wojtkiewicz, 2021)](https://consensus.app/papers/framework-collective-systems-palak/eeada4cd132a533097ee483f788c78c4/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    
2. **Non-Clausal Reasoning with Definite Theories**: Stachniak (2001) proposes a first-order automated reasoning framework based on ==definite formulas== {>>What are definite formulas?<<}and a non-clausal variant of SLD-resolution, offering a universal Horn clause-like representation of knowledge for a range of first-order logics [(Stachniak, 2001)](https://consensus.app/papers/nonclausal-reasoning-definite-theories-stachniak/c3c2ee1cefe5539bbad365037721f676/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    
3. **Combining Active Learning and Semi-Supervised Learning Schemes**: Karlos et al. (2021) discuss a framework that combines active learning and semi-supervised learning for classification tasks in acoustical signals, showing the benefits of adopting such semi-automated approaches [(Karlos, Aridas, Kanas, & Kotsiantis, 2021)](https://consensus.app/papers/classification-signals-combining-learning-strategies-karlos/dc75c669db8f57a9b53f413168766e81/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    
4. **Automating Separation Logic Using SMT**: Piskac, Wies, and Zufferey (2013) present a reduction of decidable separation logic (SL) fragments to a first-order theory that fits well into the satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) framework, automating SL satisfiability, entailment, frame inference, and abduction problems using SMT solvers [(Piskac, Wies, & Zufferey, 2013)](https://consensus.app/papers/automating-separation-logic-using-piskac/09bfe6bad7e95624b4ef559c3d44c1ce/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    
5. **Evidential Reasoning Systems**: Lowrance, Garvey, and Strat (1990) present a framework for implementing automated reasoning systems based on evidential reasoning techniques, particularly focusing on the Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions [(Lowrance, Garvey, & Strat, 1990)](https://consensus.app/papers/framework-evidentialreasoning-systems-lowrance/c2b5aa85b6c75ffaa29420500586b213/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    
6. **Reasoning about Agents in the KARO Framework**: Hustadt et al. (2001) propose methods for automated reasoning about agent-based systems within the KARO logic, which is a combination of various modal logics including propositional dynamic logic, modal logic of knowledge, and others [(Hustadt, Dixon, Schmidt, Fisher, Meyer, & Hoek, 2001)](https://consensus.app/papers/reasoning-agents-karo-framework-hustadt/7f0184884d3b55ee98c3f1a3f96fd5f1/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    
7. **Integrated Data and Knowledge Driven Methodology**: Jia and Chen (2020) discuss a hierarchical structure-based framework for human activity recognition integrating data-driven machine learning methods and symbolic reasoning [(Jia & Chen, 2020)](https://consensus.app/papers/integrated-data-knowledge-driven-activity-recognition-jia/cd0860f06f26572da7feaac677b19087/?utm_source=chatgpt).
    

These approaches highlight the diversity and richness of automated reasoning methodologies, ranging from collective systems and non-clausal reasoning to combining machine learning with symbolic reasoning for complex tasks.

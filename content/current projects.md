## Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance
Coming soon.

## Innovation and Impact Hub (TRIC-DT)
I lead the Innovation and Impact Hub for the Turing's Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins (TRIC-DT). The Innovation and Impact Hub helps coordinate and convene the scientific aims and objectives of the TRIC-DT's three themes—natural environment, health, and infrastructure—by supporting the development of open and reproducible tools, driving impact with diverse stakeholders, building and supporting multi-disciplinary communities of practice, and embedding best practices for responsible research and innovation throughout the TRIC-DT.

## Turing Commons
I lead the [Turing Commons](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/turing-commons)—an online skills and training platform to support open dialogue and reflection about the responsible design, development, and deployment of data-driven technologies. Through this platform, you can access many free resources and content, and also access information about how you can contribute to its ongoing development.

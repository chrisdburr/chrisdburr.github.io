## Background

Prior to joining the Alan Turing Institute, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford. Before this, I worked at the Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol where I explored the ethical and epistemological impact of big data and artificial intelligence as part of the thinkBIG project.

I completed my PhD in 2017 at the Department of Philosophy, University of Bristol. My thesis was on emobodied decision-making as understood from the perspective of the predictive processing hypothesis.

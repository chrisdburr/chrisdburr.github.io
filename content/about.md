title: About Me
---
I am a Senior Researcher in Trustworthy Systems at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/christopher-burr), in the [Tools, Practices, and Systems](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) programme. I lead the Innovation and Impact Hub for the [Turing Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/tric-dt). I am also the Principal Investigator for the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance of Digital Twins project (funded by UKRI), and project lead for the [Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance (TEA) Platform](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AssurancePlatform).

My research expertise includes trustworthy AI systems ü§ù, digital twinning üîÅ, responsible research and innovation ‚öñÔ∏è, data and AI ethics ü§ñ, and philosophy of cognitive science üß†. I currently lead the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance of Digital Twins (TEA-DT) project, supported by a grant from the UKRI's BRAID programme. 

My research has been featured in the [Conversation](https://theconversation.com/charities-are-contributing-to-growing-mistrust-of-mental-health-text-support-heres-why-179056), the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/19/mental-health-helpline-funded-by-royals-shared-users-conversations), BBC Radio 4, the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/technology/facebook-instagram-threads.html) and [Vox](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/11/28/18102745/cellphone-distraction-brain-health-screens-kids). I have also advised numerous regulators and policy-makers and worked with the Ministry of Justice; Office for Artificial Intelligence; Information Commissioner's Office; Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation; the Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology; and the Department of Health and Social Care.

But my most important research is the constant learning involved with being a loving father and husband üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß! When I'm not figuring out how to do the above, you can find me at the bouldering gym figuring out how to ascend a bouldering problem üßó

## Background

Prior to joining the Alan Turing Institute, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford. Before this, I worked at the Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol where I explored the ethical and epistemological impact of big data and artificial intelligence as part of the thinkBIG project.

I completed my PhD in 2017 at the Department of Philosophy, University of Bristol. My thesis was on embodied decision-making as understood from the perspective of the predictive processing hypothesis.

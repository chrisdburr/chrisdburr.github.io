Hello, World 👋
```

I am an Senior Researcher in Trustworthy Systems at the [Alan Turing Institute's](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/christopher-burr), in the Tools, Practices, and Systems programme. I also lead the Innovation and Impact Hub for the Turing's Research and Innovation Cluster in Digital Twins (TRIC-DT).

My research expertise includes trustworthy AI systems 🤝, digital twinning 🔁, responsible research and innovation ⚖️, data and AI ethics 🤖, and philosophy of cognitive science 🧠. I currently lead the Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance of Digital Twins (TEA-DT) project, supported by a grant from the UKRI's BRAID programme. For other projects I am involved with, see [below](#current-projects)

But my most important research is the constant learning involved with being a loving father and husband 👨‍👩‍👧! When I'm not figuring out how to do the above, you can find me at the bouldering gym figuring out how to ascend a bouldering problem 🧗

My research has been featured in the [Conversation](https://theconversation.com/charities-are-contributing-to-growing-mistrust-of-mental-health-text-support-heres-why-179056), the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/19/mental-health-helpline-funded-by-royals-shared-users-conversations), BBC Radio 4, the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/technology/facebook-instagram-threads.html) and [Vox](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/11/28/18102745/cellphone-distraction-brain-health-screens-kids). I have also advised numerous policy makers and worked with the Ministry of Justice, Office for Artificial Intelligence, Information Commissioner's Office, Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and the Department of Health and Social Care.

## Current Projects

I lead the [Turing Commons](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/turing-commons)—an online skills and training platform to support open dialogue and reflection about the responsible design, development, and deployment of data-driven technologies. Through this platform, you can access many free resources and content, and also access information about how you can contribute to its ongoing development.

For my previous work, please see [[past-projects]] or [[publications]].

Until July 2022, I was the Principal Investigator of a UKRI-funded project, supported by the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Hub, titled '[Ethical Assurance of Digital Mental Healthcare](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ethical-assurance-digital-mental-healthcare)'. The goal of this project was to develop a method for assuring ethical goals and claims associated with the design, development, deployment, and use of data-driven technologies in mental healthcare. You can read our final policy report [here](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/trustworthy-assurance).

I am also a co-organiser of the Special Interest Group at the Alan Turing Institute, '[Facilitating Responsible Participation in Data Science](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/facilitating-responsible-participation-data-science)'. This group is open to all, and has the goal of understanding how to increase participation in data science in a responsible and ethical manner. Please get in touch if you're interested in joining.

A full list of the current projects I am involved with at the Alan Turing Institute can be found on my [profile page](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/christopher-burr).

## Background

Prior to joining the Alan Turing Institute, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford. Before this, I worked at the Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol where I explored the ethical and epistemological impact of big data and artificial intelligence as part of the thinkBIG project.

I completed my PhD in 2017 at the Department of Philosophy, University of Bristol. My thesis was on emobodied decision-making as understood from the perspective of the predictive processing hypothesis.

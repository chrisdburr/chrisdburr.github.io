## Trustworthy and Ethical Assurance of Digital Health and Healthcare
This collaborative project between the Assuring Autonomy International Programme (University of York) and The Alan Turing Institute sought to harmonise existing research in ethical assurance, which our respective teams had been engaged with. The focus was on fairness in digital healthcare, looking at how project teams could use the TEA platform to meet ethical and regulatory best practices in health research and healthcare.

A final project report was published in early 2024, and is available here: https://zenodo.org/records/10532573 

## Human Rights, Democracy, and the Rule of Law Assurance Framework
The Human Rights, Democracy, and the Rule of Law Assurance Framework for AI Systems was completed and submitted to the Council of Europe in September 2021. It presents an end-to-end approach to the assurance of AI project lifecycles that integrates context-based risk analysis and appropriate stakeholder engagement with comprehensive impact assessment, and transparent risk management, impact mitigation, and innovation assurance practices. Taken together, these interlocking processes constitute a Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law Assurance Framework (HUDERAF).

## Trustworthy Assurance of Digital Mental Healthcare
Until July 2022, I was the Principal Investigator of a UKRI-funded project, supported by the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Hub, titled '[Trustworthy Assurance of Digital Mental Healthcare](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ethical-assurance-digital-mental-healthcare)'. The goal of this project was to develop a method for assuring ethical goals and claims associated with the design, development, deployment, and use of data-driven technologies in mental healthcare.

## Co-Developing a Data Charter
In 2021, in collaboration with Camden Council and Involve (and supported by funding from Wellcome), we delivered a series of education-based public engagement workshops—known collectively as a Resident Panel. The panel was diverse and represented the community, and has supported Camden’s residents with the development and update of a data charter that can help ensure that the council's ongoing use of citizen data works for the common good.

## Facilitating Responsible Participation in Data Science

I was previously a co-organiser of the Special Interest Group at the Alan Turing Institute, '[Facilitating Responsible Participation in Data Science](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/facilitating-responsible-participation-data-science)'. This group met regularly to share knowledge and understanding about how to increase participation in data science in a responsible and ethical manner.

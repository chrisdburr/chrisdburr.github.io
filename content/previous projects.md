## Trustworthy Assurance of Digital Mental Healthcare
Until July 2022, I was the Principal Investigator of a UKRI-funded project, supported by the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Hub, titled '[Trustworthy Assurance of Digital Mental Healthcare](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ethical-assurance-digital-mental-healthcare)'. The goal of this project was to develop a method for assuring ethical goals and claims associated with the design, development, deployment, and use of data-driven technologies in mental healthcare.

This group met regularly to share knowledge and understanding about how to increase participation in data science in a responsible and ethical manner.
